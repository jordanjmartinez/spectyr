Items approved for later work. Each entry names its target window; nothing

## Indexed multi-account placeholders

**Target: before end of Stage 2.**

Add indexed employee placeholders (`{username_1}` through `{username_n}`,
resolved as distinct roster picks per run) to the scenario placeholder
grammar, then migrate `password_spray` off its grandfathered literal
usernames (dpark, mjohnson, bwilliams, achen, jkim, lgreen).

Why: the literals are static values in chain content (placeholder-integrity
exemption), they pin the sprayed accounts to six specific roster employees,
and the runtime victim pick can collide with a sprayed account. Indexed
placeholders make every run's target set unique and remove the exemption.

Scope notes for the implementer:
- Grammar and resolution live in `scenario_loader.py` (v1, frozen) vs
  `scenario_loader_v2.py`: implement resolution for the v2 path only, and
  route it through `resolve_entities`-style per-run resolution so the same
  index always yields the same employee within a run.
- Requires an approved correction record (scenario_corrections.py) for the
  password_spray chain rewrite, with the parity divergences enumerated.
- The environment accounts and answer_key.scope.accounts for password_spray
  must switch from literal ids to the indexed placeholders' resolved ids.
- Remove the six username entries from the placeholder-integrity
  grandfather allowlist in `test_scenario_loader_v2.py` when done.
